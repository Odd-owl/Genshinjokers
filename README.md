This is a small project that adds some balatro cards based on genshin/hsr characters that I update from time to time.
I try to keep the main branch relatively stable, but it's not guaranteed to be bug-free or fully tested at all times, however you're free to download it, try it, and edit it yourself if you want.

Recommended: delete the jokers.png.kra file in in the assets/2x folder to save space if you don't plan to edit anything or don't have Krita, that file is just there to share between my pc and laptop.

Requires lovely and steammodded, and a legally acquired pc copy of balatro if you want to run it.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or find a bug you can message me on discord (odd_owl722).
