This is a small project that adds some balatro cards based on genshin/hsr characters that I update from time to time.
I try to keep the main branch relatively stable, but it's not guaranteed to be bug-free or fully tested at all times, however you're free to download it, try it, and edit it yourself if you want.

Requires lovely and steammodded, and a legally acquired pc copy of balatro if you want to run it.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or find a bug you can message me on discord (odd_owl722).
